# Incident Management System

**Purpose:** Within the Incident Management System, the incidents will be processed based on the workflow associated with the incidents.

## Steps

- **Step 1:** All the incidents that are supposed to be dispatched to the units will be displayed in the “Waiting for Dispatch” grid within the Map in the IMS. To view the incidents in the “Waiting for Dispatch” grid, select Map Icon.

- **Step 4:** On selecting the incident from Waiting for Dispatch grid, the system will show the nearest unit which is available to dispatch the incident.

- **Step 5:** The user can dispatch the incident to the unit by dragging the incident and dropping it on the Unit.

- **Step 6:** Once the incident has been assigned to the Unit, the driver can either accept or reject the incident from Dispatch Application. On rejecting the incident, the users can Dispatch the Incident to another vehicle. The log details of rejection by the driver will be displayed in the History Tab of the applicable incident.

- **Step 7:** On accepting the incident by the driver from the Dispatch application, the status of the incident will get changed to Dispatched and the incident will be displayed on the “Dispatched” grid.

- **Step 8:** Within IMS, the users can view the details of further status updates by the driver from the Dispatch application.

- **Step 9:** Once the Driver has updated all the status updates (as per the secondary workflow configured) from Dispatch application, the users can then further change the status of the incident until its final lifecycle as per the workflow configured from the IMS screen.
