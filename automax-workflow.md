# Workflow Management System

**Purpose:** Automax has a system-defined status as “Dispatched”. To dispatch incidents to Units, the workflow needs to be configured including the “Dispatch” status. Also, once the incidents are assigned to Units, the drivers within the Units can perform further transitions in the dispatch application based on the Workflow. The workflow applicable to the Dispatch application can be configured as the secondary workflow associated with the Main Workflow.

## Steps

- **Step 1:** Configure the appropriate Workflow involving Dispatched Status.

- **Step 2:** When the status as “Dispatched” gets associated with a Workflow, then the options to create the workflow applicable for the Dispatch application will appear.

- Once the Secondary workflow is created, the user can view the Main workflow details by clicking the Button “View Main Workflow”.
